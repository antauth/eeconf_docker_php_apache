# PHP/MySQL on Apache Docker Starter

## Prerequisites

You have installed Docker locally. 

[Install for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-mac/install/). You can also use Docker on Windows and Linux (I just didn't link to the instructions).

## Getting started

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Make an app directory in the root of the project.
3. Place your PHP app into the app directory.
4. In your terminal, run `docker-compose up`.
5. Visit your running application at _localhost:8080_.
